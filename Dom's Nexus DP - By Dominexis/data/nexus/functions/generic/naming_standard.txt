Naming standard of generic function variables

All fakeplayer variables with the terms "input", "output", or "math" will begin with the respective term.
Functions with single inputs and/or outputs will use the standard input and output names.
Generic functions should avoid referencing each other if it means extra commands to transfer values between scores. Functions with simple inputs and outputs are acceptable.
